Rules And Regulations of this Course
------------------------------------

1. join the classes using the registered email id only (Very important for the attendance part)

2. the attendance will be calculated in the following way
	for Example : if the class id there for 2 hours everyday for 30 days => 60 
	then if you joined the class for 1 hours in a day then you attendance will be like 
		1/2 => 50 % per that day like this everyday the attendance will be calculated for all the classes happened in the online
	

	even if you were out of the call for some time like 2 minutes also till will deduct this time in total present time of the class
	even due to network issues if you missed 5 - 10 minutes of class that will be also calculated as a missed time

	if attendance less then 70% percentage then you are not eligible for the placements
	so strictly we have to follow the timings there is not other way

since this is some what free course people think we won't care much but this is not the case with my batch i will check each and everything by my self to make sure that opportunities are going to the right people only 


3. while the course is going on each and every module will have some labs and mcq that is vey much compulsory for the certification part if you are not doing the labs then there are high chances that you may not get the certificate ( or get the certificate with c or d grade mentioning on the certificate)



4. along with labs mcqs we have more better ways of learning is there like aptitude and icharts sprint(project)


5. Auto Dropout if you are absent or attendance is less than 50% or not doing the labs or taks given to you then automatically system will remove you from the cmis and considers you as dropout and you will not longer able to get the certificate we need to be carefull in each step
